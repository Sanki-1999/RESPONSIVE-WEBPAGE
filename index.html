            <p class="secsubtag text-small ">The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to
                reach students who couldn't be on a university campus.[1] By the early 1900s, communication technologies
                improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of
                Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to
                educational broadcasting.[1] Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded through the
                invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The University of Iowa
                began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s. It was not until the 1950s,
                when the FCC began to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that telecourses caught
                the attention of the public. The value of television for education was furthered by the establishment of
                the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. The CPB mission was "to encourage the growth and
                development of public radio and television broadcasting, including the use of such media for
                instructional, educational, and cultural purposes" (as cited in,[1] p. 27)..</p>

            <p class="sectag text-big">Online operators (methods of delivery)</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small ">Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments
                provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings.[20][21] Online platforms
                can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in
                the twenty-first century.[22] The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's
                geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content.[22] Courses
                offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning
                format.

                Asynchronous learning environments are described as online spaces where work is supported through the
                use of digital platforms in such a way that participants are not required to be online at the same
                time.[23][24] Threaded discussions, e-mail, and telephone calls are options of asynchronous
                delivery.[25] This gives meaning to the anytime-anywhere appeal of online learning.[26] A benefit of
                asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the
                instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements.[23] The
                additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information.[23]
                The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal
                academic writing.[27] On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the
                greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment. </p>

            <p class="sectag text-big">Learning management systems</p>
            <p class="secsubtag text-small ">Most online learning occurs through a college's or university's learning
                management system (LMS). A LMS is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking
                educational resources. According to the Educause Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) use of a LMS is
                nearly ubiquitous as 99% of colleges and universities report having one in place.[29] Among faculty, 87%
                report using a LMS and find them useful for "enhancing teaching (74%) and student learning (71%)"
                [29](p. 10). Similarly, 83% of students use an LMS for their learning, with the majority (56%) using
                them in most or all courses.

                Most institutions utilize LMSs by external vendors (77%), Blackboard currently dominates the LMS
                environment with an adoption rate of 31.9%, followed by Moodle at 19.1%, and Canvas at 15.3%.[30]
                However, in the last year Canvas, by Instructure, has gained an increasing amount of the market share
                (see graphic).
